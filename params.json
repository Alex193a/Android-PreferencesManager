Without **root access**, it can't do anything.\r\n\r\nAndroid provides several options for developers to save application data. The most frequent solution is the **Shared Preferences** framework. It's a simple way to store private primitive data in key-value pairs.\r\nUnfortunately, this method is not very secure... It consists in a simple XML file stored in the private folder, specific to the app. But in the case of a rooted device, theses files can be read, edited and even deleted.\r\n\r\nPreferences Manager allows you to edit these preferences in a simple and easy way.\r\nYou can for instance increase your highscores, modify your progression, or just debug your application preferences.\r\n\r\n*Disclaimer : I take no responsibility for any fault or damage caused by any procedures within this application. Do only use it if you really know what you are doing. I don't assume any liability if you brick your device or any application. If an application does not work properly anymore, you can clear its data from the Settings app.\r\nYou may not use the application for any illegal or unauthorized purpose!*\r\n\r\n## Beta testing\r\n\r\nIf you want to opt-in to the Beta program, you need to join this **[Google+ Community](https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/112244514442534711821)**.\r\n\r\nTest it, have fun, and please submit any feedback you have!\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n![Screenshot][screen1]\r\n![Screenshot][screen2]\r\n![Screenshot][screen3]\r\n![Screenshot][screen4]\r\n![Screenshot][screen5]\r\n![Screenshot][screen6]\r\n\r\n## Pull requests\r\n\r\nFeel free to contribute to PreferencesManager.\r\n\r\nEither you found a bug or have created a new and awesome feature, just create a pull request.\r\n\r\nIf you want to start to create a new feature or have any other questions regarding PreferencesManager, [file an issue](https://github.com/SimonMarquis/Android-PreferencesManager/issues/new).\r\n\r\n## Developed By\r\n\r\n* [Simon Marquis][1]\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\n * [SpazeDog][2] - Author of [RootFW][3], an Android Root Shell Framework.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n\tCopyright (C) 2013 Simon Marquis (http://www.simon-marquis.fr)\r\n\t\r\n\tLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not\r\n\tuse this file except in compliance with the License.
